- It is HIGHLY recommended that you join the #Amonbit-dev IRC channel if you are developing software that uses Amonbit. Due to the nature of this open source software project, joining this channel and idling is the best way to stay updated on best practices and new developments in the Amonbit ecosystem. All you need to do is join the IRC channel and idle to stay updated with the latest in Amonbit development. If you do not, you risk wasting resources on developing integrations that are not compatible with the Amonbit network. The Amonbit core team and community continuously make efforts to communicate updates, developments, and documentation via other platforms â€“ but for the best information, you need to talk to other Amonbit developers, and they are on IRC. #amonbit-dev is about Amonbit development, not getting help about using Amonbit, or help about development of other software, including yours, unless it also pertains to Amonbit code itself. For these cases, checkout #Amonbit.

## Introduction

Amonbit is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency and asset management. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.

## About this project

The rise of online insecurity has led to a significant reduction in freedom of speech,
hindering daily social activities on the internet.
Users' data is no longer adequately protected, relying solely on passwords
and a six-character string/figure as a second factor of authentication, without the
consensus of other trusted devices. Centralized organizations have complete control over databases,
which can be easily wiped out without any consequences.

It is vital to ensure privacy for everyone. However, with increasing government control over the internet,
individuals' assets and funds may be subject to regulation. The internet has become a platform where
conversations are monitored by staff, who falsely promise end-to-end encryption without providing any supporting code.

Individuals' private lives are now widely publicized, and they are often coerced into accepting
policies that could be detrimental to them. Even when suing organizations, the policies are frequently ignored.

Amonbit aims to solve these issues by achieving consensus on assets, conventions, and security, ensuring adequate protection for users' privacy.
